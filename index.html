						<h2>Issue #1</h2>
						<p>
							A number of people didn't seem to make use of the top navigation on desktop devices 
							and couldn't find the self-guided tasting passports page.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img src="img/issue1.gif" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Potential Solution</h2>
						<p>
							We hypothesized that users were mistaking the links for regular text and 
							thought that by adding subtle indications we could overcome this issue.
						</p>
						<p>

							<img src="img/test1-var2.gif" alt=""><br>
							<img src="img/test1-var3.gif" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>
							We decided this would make a simple test and ran that experiment 
							over the period of 1 week. Unfortunately, the results were extremely 
							poor and we decided to end the experiment early as a result.
						</p>
						<p>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Issue #2</h2>
						<p>
							Lots of people made mention of the fact that they weren't very clear on what they 
							would be able to pick with regards to their tasting options.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Potential Solution</h2>
						<p>This was proposed and implemented by GLG</p>
						<p>
							<img src="img/issue2-solution.gif" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>
							This was considered to be particularly low risk and this wasn't run in the form of 
							an A/B test.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, we don't know what impact that has made as a result.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Issue #3</h2>
						<p>
							It took at least one person <strong>over 10 minutes</strong> to understand 
							that the price <strong>included food</strong>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img src="img/issue3-hero.gif" style="height: 80%; width: 80%;" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Potential Solution</h2>
						<p>
							Identify opportunities to improve the clarity around this fact, 
							primarially through copy updates.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Status</h2>
						<p>
							This has yet to be addressed thus far.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Issue #4</h2>
						<p>
							We saw people making heavy use of the tour finder to understand our product 
							offerings however, it doesn't feature a blade for any of the Tasting 
							Passport options. While we have some information below, nobody scrolled 
							that far down the page.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img src="img/issue4-example.gif" style="height: 50%; width: 50%;" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Potential Solution</h2>
						<p>
							Add the tour finder table
						</p>
						<img src="img/issue4-solution.png" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Potential Solution</h2>
						<p>
							Update the tour finder
						</p>
						<img src="img/issue4-solution2.gif" style="height: 50%; width: 50%;" alt="">
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Considerations</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>This was quoted as $7,500 just to update the tour finder</li>
							<li>That did not include any kind of testing</li>
							<li>Did not include updating the table</li>
							<li>Main risk is introducting an analysis paralysis style situation</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Issue #5</h2>
						<p>
							Pricing isn't very clear on mobile devices
						</p>
						<p>
							<img src="img/issue5.gif" style="width: 25%;" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Potential Solution</h2>
						<p>
							<img src="img/issue5-solution1.gif" style="width: 40%;" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Alternative Solution</h2>
						<p>
							<img src="img/issue5-solution2.gif" style="width: 50%;" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Issue #6</h2>
						<p>
							A number of users complained about the script font we were using as it 
							made the pricing difficult to read.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img src="img/issue6-pricing.png" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Potential Solution</h2>
						<p>
							Pick a more appropriate font and replace it across the site or 
							potentially just for the relevant pricing sections.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Status</h2>
						<p>Yet to be addressed thus far but considered very low risk.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Issue #7</h2>
						<p>
							Many of our testers made heavy use of the homepage slider to see our options but we 
							don't currently have a blade for any of our passport options.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Potential Solution</h2>
						<p>
							Add a blade for each of the passport options.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img src="img/homepage-blade.jpg" alt="">
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Considerations</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Current quoted price to implement this is $3,400 but we can implement 
								most of this already for free.
							</li>
							<li>
								Example shown in previous slide was done via the CMS in 10 minutes.
							</li>
							<li>
								Overall considered low risk to implement.
							</li>
						</ul>
